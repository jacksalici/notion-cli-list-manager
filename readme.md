![](showcase.gif)

## 📺 Features:
- fast and clear; saving your idea is as simple as type `add "get money"` 💆‍♂️
- tables are pretty-printed with fab ASCII tables 🌈
- parameters are now supported [^3] 🎻


## 👾 Get Started:
- Create a new internal api integration [here](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
- ❗️ Share the default database you want to use with your integration.  
  You can copy [my free simple template](https://jacksalici.notion.site/d75c9590dc8b4d62a6c65cbf3fdd1dfb?v=0e3782222f014d7bb3e44a87376e3cfb).
- Download the tool: [^1]
```
    pip install notion-cli-list-manager
```
- Set the token and your default database id:
```
    list set --token [token] --id [database-id]
``` 
- You're done!

## 🧰 Syntax:
TL;DR: `list` is the keyword for activate this tool from the terminal. Typing just `list`, the list of your default database's items will be shown. Other commands can be use typing `list [command]`

| Commands:|    | Args and options:|
|---|---|---|
| `list` | to display all the ___List___ items. | `--db [id] ` to display a specific database. Otherwise the default database will be shown.<br> `--all` to display all the lists.
| `list add [title]` | to add a new ___List___ item called `title`. |   `[title]` will be the text of the ___List___ item (and the title of the associated Notion database page)  <br> `--db [id] ` to add the entry to a specific database. Otherwise, the default database will be used.| 
| `list rm [index]` | to remove the ___List___ item with the index `index`.  <br> _(Command to call after `list`)_| `[index]` has to be formatted either like a range or a list, or a combination of these. E.g.: 3,4,6:10:2 will remove pages 3, 4, 6, 8.
| `list db` | to display all the notion display saved in the manager. | `--label [LABEL] --id [ID]` to add a database to the manager. A prompt will then ask you the ordered indexes list.<br> `--rm [LABEL]` to remove a database named [LABEL] from the manager. Note that adding or removing a database to the manager does not cause the actual creation or deletion on Notion. <br> `--prop [LABEL]` to set which and in which order display the properties of an already saved database labeled [LABEL]. A prompt will then ask you the ordered indexes list[^3].
| `list set --token [token] --id [database_id]` | to set the token and the ID of the Notion Database you want as default. _This must be executed as the first command_. | You can get the `[token]` as internal api integration [here](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations). <br> You can get the database id from the database url: notion.so/[username]/`[database_id]`?v=[view_id]. <br> You can also use separately `--token` and `--id` to set just one parameter. After the `--id` command, a prompt will then ask you the ordered indexes list.   |
